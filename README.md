# 🌱 Micro Adventure – A Tiny SwiftUI Game

**Micro Adventure** is a fun, bite-sized iOS app built with SwiftUI that encourages users to take small, mindful actions throughout their day.  
Each time you tap the button, you get a new "micro-adventure" — something quick, simple, and refreshing to do.

## 🧠 What It Does

This app randomly selects and displays a small task or idea such as:
- “Take a 5-min walk”
- “Draw a doodle using only circles”
- “Text a friend something funny”
- “Write down one thing you’re grateful for”

Each prompt is designed to give you a little boost of creativity, mindfulness, or joy — perfect for quick breaks or when you’re feeling stuck.

- **Xcode** – for development and iOS simulation  
- **State Management (@State)** – to update the displayed adventure dynamically

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The app stores a list of micro-adventures in an array.  
2. When the user taps the **"Generate Adventure"** button, it picks one randomly.  
3. The chosen adventure appears instantly on screen.
